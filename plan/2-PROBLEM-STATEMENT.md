2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
2.1 Current Dynamic Grid Issues
Timeline of Disaster:

t=0: Seed BUY + SELL @ 1.1000
├─ Warm 5 pending levels each side
└─ Total: 10 market + 10 pending = 20 orders ready

t=1: Strong uptrend → 1.1300 (300 pips)
├─ SELL L0-L5 ALL FILLED (6 positions trapped)
├─ BUY profits, closes at TP
└─ Dynamic grid refills SELL L6-L10 near current price

t=2: Current state
├─ SELL L0-L5: 1.1000-1.1250 (trapped deep)
├─ SELL L6-L10: 1.1300-1.1500 (new levels)
└─ GAP: 50 pips between L5 and L6

Problem:
├─ Average price: ~1.1180
├─ TP target: 1.1150 (avg - 30 pips for +$5)
├─ Current: 1.1300
└─ Need 150 pips retrace → MAY NEVER HAPPEN! ❌
2.2 Gap Trap Scenarios
Scenario A: Sideways in Gap
Price oscillates 1.1200-1.1280 (in the gap)
├─ Old levels (L0-L5): Still trapped deep
├─ New levels (L6-L10): Not filling
├─ Average: Fixed at 1.1180
└─ Result: NEVER reach TP, infinite loop ❌
Scenario B: Trend Continues
Price continues up → 1.1500
├─ Old SELL levels: -500 pips loss
├─ New SELL levels: Start filling
├─ Average: Gets worse
└─ Result: DD spirals to margin call ❌
Scenario C: Grid Full on Both Sides
Price crashes after uptrend
├─ SELL basket: Already trapped
├─ BUY basket: Now fills completely (grid full)
├─ Both baskets: Losing simultaneously
└─ Result: Double exposure, double pain ❌
