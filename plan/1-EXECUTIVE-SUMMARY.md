1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Current State
The EA uses a dynamic grid fill approach that pre-fills multiple pending levels (warm levels). When a strong trend occurs, the grid gets fully populated before trend detection kicks in, causing significant drawdown and "gap traps."
Problem

Gap Trap: After strong trend, positions are far apart (gap), making it nearly impossible to reach break-even or profit
Overexposure: Grid fills too fast during strong trends, multiplying losses
No Escape: Traditional TP targets are too far when gap exists

Solution: "Lazy Grid Fill + Smart Trap Detection + Quick Exit"
Core Innovations:

Lazy Grid Fill: Only 1-2 pending levels at a time, expand on-demand with trend checks
Trap Detection: Multi-condition algorithm detects when basket is trapped (gap + counter-trend + DD + time)
Quick Exit Mode: Accept small loss (-$10 to -$20) to escape trap fast
Gap Management: Bridge levels, close far positions, or reseed when gap too large

Expected Benefits

✅ Reduced DD: 50-70% reduction in max drawdown during strong trends
✅ Faster Recovery: Escape traps in minutes instead of hours/days
✅ Better Win Rate: More closures at break-even or small loss vs large loss
✅ Simpler Architecture: No multi-job complexity, single lifecycle management
