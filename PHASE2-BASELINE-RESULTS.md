## üîÑ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED)**: Fix Scenario 2, complete Phase 2 baseline
   - Reason: Need solid baseline for comparison
   - Risk: Low (just fixing test setup)
   - Time: 30-60 minutes

2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **OPTION 2**: Skip to Phase 3 with 3/4 baselines
   - Reason: Already have trend/whipsaw/gap data
   - Risk: Missing critical SELL trap baseline
   - Not recommended - Scenario 2 is THE KEY test for trap detection

**Recommendation**: Complete Scenario 2 first. It's the most important test case for validating Phase 3-7 (Lazy Grid + Trap Detection + Quick Exit).
